# Implementation of $I_\cap^\star$

This code requires the Python version of *Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL)* to be installed. This can be done in the following manner:

* `pip install cysignals --user`
* `pip install gmpy2==2.1.0a4 --user`
* `pip install pplpy`


Our code expects a joint distribution over sources and target to be passed in, in [dit|https://github.com/dit/dit] format.

For basic usage, see `simpledemo.py`.
